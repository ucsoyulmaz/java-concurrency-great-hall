King Arthur and the knights interact according to a set of strict rules.  Knights enter the Great Hall,discuss their adventures with one another, and sit at the Round Table.  At some point, King Arthur en-ters the Great Hall.  While King Arthur is in the Great Hall, knights may not enter or leave.  Once allthe knights who are present in the Great Hall are also seated at the Round Table, King Arthur starts ameeting.  During a meeting, knights report back on and release their completed quest (if they have one)and acquire new quests.  Once a knight has acquired a new quest, they may stand up from the RoundTable, and spend more time discussing their adventures with one another.  Once all knights have stoodup from the Round Table, King Arthur ends the meeting.  At some point after the meeting ends, KingArthur leaves the Great Hall, and the knights may leave the Great Hall to complete their quests.  Aftercompleting their quests, the knights return to the Great Hall and the process begins anew.
